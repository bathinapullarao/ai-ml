# Learning Objectives
``` bash
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

Explain and apply operators in Python for performing arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations.
Implement decision-making constructs (such as if, elif, and else) to control program flow based on conditions.
Use looping structures (for and while loops) to execute repetitive tasks efficiently.
Create and manipulate lists for storing and processing ordered collections of data.
Work with tuples to handle immutable sequences in Python.
Utilize dictionaries for key-value data storage and retrieval.
Define and call functions to organize code into reusable blocks.
Perform file input and output (I/O) operations to read from and write to external files.
Import and use modules to extend Python functionality and organize code.
Handle exceptions using try-except blocks to make programs robust and error-tolerant.

# What is Python?
``` bash
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development and
system scripting.
```
# What can Python do?
``` bash
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
```

# Why Python?
``` bash
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
```

#Executing a Python Program
``` bash
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. You can also execute your Python program using vscode, anaconda navigator and google colab.
